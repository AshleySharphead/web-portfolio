            <h2 id="about">About Us: This is a bit about the vision of my bookstore</h2>

            <p>A cozy spot to read and a chance to socialize with other people who might have the same taste in literature as you. Focused more on a 3rd place to read and socialize rather than a space where you're in total silence (surrounded by people, yet isolated). A 3rd place known for socializing and enjoying good book recommendations. I picture a cafe style offering light snacks and drinks. Be prepared to explain what you're reading as this is good practice and an acceptable opening to discuss the books you're currently passionate about. </p>
